## Description

This project is focused on developing a speech recognition system that can transcribe spoken words into text. It utilizes deep learning techniques and neural network architectures to process audio data and extract meaningful information from speech signals.

## Usage

To use the speech recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the `speech_recognition.py` script to start the speech recognition system.
3. Speak into the microphone connected to your computer.
4. The system will transcribe your speech into text and display the results on the screen.
